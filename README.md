# Arduino LCD Stopwatch
Arduino stopwatch for Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). Goes up to around 9 hours, which is based off the highest possible integer in a 16-bit architecture. Room to i.ncrease once code is optimised

Still a few bugs to remove such as the 's' for seconds occurring twice for single-digit numbers after the first minute.
